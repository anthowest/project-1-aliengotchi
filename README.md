## **Necessary Deliverables**

☐ The code for **a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages** (covered next week).

- **A `README.md` file** with these sections:
    
    ☐ **Aliengotchi**: Player has been given the task to name and take care of the family's new alien. Player must stay active to keep their alien alive. If the alien's hunger and/or happiness meter hits 0% - player loses. 
    
    ☐ **Screenshot(s):** Images of your actual game.
    
    ☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...
    
    ☐ **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.
    
    ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).
    
    > Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well-crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!
